This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and repl [...]"
YY1,Transcriptional repressor protein YY1; Multifunctional transcription factor that exhibits positive and negative control on a large number of cellular and viral genes by binding to sites overlapping the transcription start site. Binds to the consensus sequence 5'-CCGCCATNTT-3'; some genes have been shown to contain a longer binding motif allowing enhanced binding; the initial CG dinucleotide can be methylated greatly reducing the binding affinity. The effect on transcription regulation is depending upon the context in which it binds and diverse mechanisms of action include direct activa [...]
ZFHX2,Zinc finger homeobox protein 2; May be involved in transcriptional regulation; ZF class homeoboxes and pseudogenes
ZFHX3,Zinc finger homeobox protein 3; Transcriptional regulator which can act as an activator or a repressor. Inhibits the enhancer element of the AFP gene by binding to its AT-rich core sequence. In concert with SMAD- dependent TGF-beta signaling can repress the transcription of AFP via its interaction with SMAD2/3. Regulates the circadian locomotor rhythms via transcriptional activation of neuropeptidergic genes which are essential for intercellular synchrony and rhythm amplitude in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain (By similarity). Regulator of myoblasts differentiation throu [...]

ZFP82,Zinc finger protein 82 homolog; May be involved in transcriptional regulation; Zinc fingers C2H2-type
ZFP90,"Zinc finger protein 90 homolog; Inhibits the transcriptional repressor activity of REST by inhibiting its binding to DNA, thereby derepressing transcription of REST target genes; Zinc fingers C2H2-type"
ZFP91,"E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ZFP91; Atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates 'Lys- 63'-linked ubiquitination of MAP3K14/NIK, leading to stabilize and activate MAP3K14/NIK. It thereby acts as an activator of the non- canonical NF-kappa-B2/NFKB2 pathway. May also play an important role in cell proliferation and/or anti-apoptosis; Belongs to the krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family"
ZFP92,Zinc finger protein 92 homolog; May be involved in transcriptional regulation; Zinc fingers C2H2-type
ZFPM1,"Zinc finger protein, fog family member 1; Zinc finger protein ZFPM1; Transcription regulator that plays an essential role in erythroid and megakaryocytic cell differentiation. Essential cofactor that acts via the formation of a heterodimer with transcription factors of the GATA family GATA1, GATA2 and GATA3. Such heterodimer can both activate or repress transcriptional activity, depending on the cell and promoter context. The heterodimer formed with GATA proteins is essential to activate expression of genes such as NFE2, ITGA2B, alpha- and beta-globin, while it represses expression of [...]"
ZFPM2,"Zinc finger protein ZFPM2; Transcription regulator that plays a central role in heart morphogenesis and development of coronary vessels from epicardium, by regulating genes that are essential during cardiogenesis. Essential cofactor that acts via the formation of a heterodimer with transcription factors of the GATA family GATA4, GATA5 and GATA6. Such heterodimer can both activate or repress transcriptional activity, depending on the cell and promoter context. Also required in gonadal differentiation, possibly be regulating expression of SRY.
